# Social Media Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on social media text data to classify the sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral categories. The goal is to analyze public opinion from textual content using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains social media posts (e.g., tweets or comments) with associated sentiment labels. (You can add source like Kaggle or mention if it’s a custom dataset.)

## Technologies Used

- *Python*
- *Pandas* – data handling
- *NumPy* – numerical operations
- *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn* – visualizations
- *Scikit-learn* – machine learning (train-test split, vectorization, model building)
- *NLTK* or *TextBlob* – natural language processing and sentiment analysis
- *Jupyter Notebook*

## Project Workflow

1. *Text Preprocessing*  
   - Lowercasing, removing punctuation, stop words, and tokenization

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - Visualization of sentiment distribution and word clouds

3. *Feature Extraction*  
   - TF-IDF or CountVectorizer used to convert text into numerical form

4. *Model Building*  
   - Used machine learning models like Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes

5. *Model Evaluation*  
   - Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## Results

- Achieved an accuracy of *[insert value]%*
- Most common words for each sentiment category were visualized using WordClouds
- The model was able to distinguish between positive, negative, and neutral posts with good performance

## Future Improvements

- Use deep learning models (like LSTM or BERT) for better results
- Deploy the model using Flask/Streamlit for real-time predictions
- Collect more real-time social media data using Twitter API
